#' MakeDive Function to make a DiveNum variable
#'
#' The objective of this function to to partition diving data into "dives"
#' based on begining and returning to a fixed location (the surface).
#' It was based on the MakeTrip codes.  This function relies on a column with a
#' depth typically in m, a depth cut off below which dives start, but also the user
#' can specify what depth must be reached to indicate a dive and also specify a time
#' gap limit.  It numbers each dive starting with the first point beyond the
#' depth cutoff and ending with the last point beyond the cutoff with a
#' sequential number starting with 1.  All points inside the cutoff (surface) are
#' labled 0. Output is just the input variables and a counter column. Depth values can
#' no include NA.
#'
#' In the future it could be nice to have these labeled with sequetial numbers as well.
#' The input variables are identified by column index numbers in the data.frame (tracks).

#' @param DepthCutOff Depth to use as a cut off to indicate surface values
#'   to use to split the dives (same units as depth). Default is 1.
#' @param DiveDepthYes Dives need to reach this depth to be considered a
